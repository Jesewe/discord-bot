### Auto Moderation

In addition to the above commands, **Ultimate Discord Bot** includes an **Auto Moderation** feature that runs in the background. This feature automatically monitors all incoming messages for banned words. The list of banned words is loaded from the bot's configuration file (`config.json`) under the `"autoModeration"` section. When a message contains one of these words, the bot will delete the message and notify the user.

For example, your `config.json` might include:

```json
{
  "token": "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN",
  "prefix": "!",
  "logging": {
    "enabled": true,
    "logFilePath": "./bot.log"
  },
  "commands": {
    "enableClearCommand": true,
    "enableJokeCommand": true
  },
  "autoModeration": {
    "bannedWords": ["badword1", "badword2", "nastyword"]
  }
}
```

## Prerequisites

Before running the bot, ensure you have the following:

- A [Discord developer account](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and a bot token.
- Node.js (v16.6.0 or higher) installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jesewe/discord-bot.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd discord-bot
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `config.json` file in the project root and add your bot token, prefix, and other configuration as shown above.

5. Start the bot:

   ```bash

   ```

## Dependencies

- [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/): A JavaScript library to interact with the Discord API.
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/): A promise-based HTTP client for making API calls.
- [Figlet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/figlet): Used to generate ASCII art from text.

## Logging

The bot logs each command execution along with timestamps for easy monitoring. By default, logs are written to both the console and an optional log file if logging is enabled in the `config.json`.

Example log format:

```
[MM/DD/YYYY, HH:MM:SS AM/PM] Command executed: !roll
```

To enable file logging, configure the `logFilePath` in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "logging": {
    "enabled": true,
    "logFilePath": "./bot.log"
  }
}
```
